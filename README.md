# CS---320-Software-Test-Automation

Throughout this course, I got a better look on how to properly and effectively use a testing framework with writing and performing my own test cases. With this knowledge came a better understanding of how to create programs that functions without any errors, while also meeting the expectations and requirements of the program. It is important to design software with these requirements in mind, as the software created will always have a function, and with that function requires certain aspects of the program to work, which is why one needs to think how to make their code easy and digestable. And easy and digestable code gives way to an easier job troubleshooting to see where and when something goes wrong, so that fixing the error can take less than 5 minutes.
